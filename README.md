# myPiano

myPiano is a little code made to the subject "Microprocessor Based Digital Systems" inside my Telecomunications degree in Universidad Carlos III de Madrid. It works by incorporating as parameters a series of musical notes according to their frequencies, you can interpret them using a speaker as well as compose a melody.

The frequencies used were (according to the Chladni scale): 

- 261,63 Hz (Do // C)
- 293,66 Hz (Re // D)
- 329,63 Hz (Mi // E)
- 349,23 Hz (Fa // F)
- 392 Hz (Sol // G)
- 440 Hz (La // A)
- 493,88 Hz (Si // B)

Although it is now obsolete, I used the STM32L512C-Discovery and it provided enough power to complete this project.
